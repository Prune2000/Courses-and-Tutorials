# Courses-and-Tutorials
All my projects made during courses and tutorials

1: Omnifood is a website built during the Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML/CSS course.
It is an interactive and responsive website about a food delivery business concept.

2: Pig game is a JavaScript project made during the Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.
It was extremely fun to build it because Jonas doesn't feed the code but rather challenges the student to write their own way of making the game work. I learned a lot through this project thanks to complicated rules like throwing a one loses the turn, asking the players which score will win before starting the game, throwing two consecutive 6 resets your score, etc.
